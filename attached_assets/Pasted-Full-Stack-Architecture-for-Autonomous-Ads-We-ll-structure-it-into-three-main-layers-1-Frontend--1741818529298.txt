Full-Stack Architecture for Autonomous Ads

Weâ€™ll structure it into three main layers:
	1.	Frontend (User Interface & Dashboard)
	â€¢	Ad creation interface (prompt-based or manual customization)
	â€¢	Real-time preview of AI-generated ads
	â€¢	Drag-and-drop editing tools
	â€¢	Analytics dashboard
	2.	Backend (AI & Automation Engine)
	â€¢	AI script generation (LLMs like GPT-4)
	â€¢	AI video generation (Unreal Engine, Stable Diffusion, RunwayML)
	â€¢	CGI and AI Avatars (MetaHuman, NVIDIA Omniverse, Reallusion)
	â€¢	Smart targeting & adaptive ads (machine learning models)
	â€¢	API integration with Google, Meta, TikTok, and YouTube Ads
	3.	Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment
	â€¢	Cloud-based rendering for CGI (AWS, NVIDIA CloudXR, or Unreal Pixel Streaming)
	â€¢	Scalable ad delivery system (Google Cloud, Firebase, or AWS Lambda)
	â€¢	Data pipelines for AI training (BigQuery, Snowflake)

Step-by-Step Development Plan

ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: AI-Powered Ad Creation (MVP Development)
	â€¢	Build a text-to-video AI system (leveraging Unreal Engine, RunwayML, or Pika Labs)
	â€¢	Implement AI Avatars with voice cloning & facial expressions (MetaHuman, ElevenLabs)
	â€¢	Add CGI & dynamic backgrounds (Unreal Engine 5, Stable Diffusion ControlNet)
	â€¢	Create the UI for selecting automation vs. manual control

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Smart Optimization & Targeting
	â€¢	AI-driven performance tracking & ad A/B testing
	â€¢	Predictive analytics for engagement & conversion
	â€¢	Real-time ad adaptation (changing visuals, text, or CTA based on performance)

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Multi-Platform Deployment & API Integrations
	â€¢	Connect to Google, Meta, TikTok, and YouTube Ads API
	â€¢	Develop programmatic ad-buying features
	â€¢	Launch cloud-based rendering & ad hosting
